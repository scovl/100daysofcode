# Text Processing Toolbox

Text Processing Toolbox is a simple application that aims to reinforce
the concepts of text manipulation, passing parameters in functions,
use of arrays and external variables in C. The application will
consist of a set of tools for text processing, including features such
as finding the longest line in a set of lines of text, remove
whitespace and trailing tabs from each line of input, print lines of
input longer than 80 characters, and more.
