# Text Processing Toolbox

## Introduction
The Text Processing Toolbox is a simple C application designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts such as text manipulation, parameter passing in functions, the use of arrays, and the management of external variables. This application provides a suite of tools for processing text, making it ideal for educational purposes and practical use in processing scripts or text data.

## Features
Text Processing Toolbox includes several features to handle text data efficiently:
- **Find the Longest Line:** Locates and returns the longest line in a given set of text lines.
- **Trim Whitespace:** Removes all leading and trailing whitespaces and tabs from each line of input.
- **Print Long Lines:** Outputs lines that exceed 80 characters in length, which is useful for formatting or analyzing text with length constraints.
- **Dynamic Text Manipulation:** Offers flexible tools to manipulate text dynamically based on user input and predefined conditions.

## Installation
To install the Text Processing Toolbox, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scovl/100daysofcode
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd tpt
   ```
3. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   bmake all
   ```

## Usage
To use the toolbox, run the compiled executable after installation:
```bash
./main
```
The program will prompt for inputs depending on the chosen text processing task. Additional command-line arguments and options will be detailed in subsequent versions.
